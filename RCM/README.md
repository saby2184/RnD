# RCM using Kmeans(numpy)

### Abstract

Customer segmentation is the process of 
grouping customers by specific likeness (demographics, 
interests, behavior, etc.) Creating customer segmentation 
enables a business to target specific groups of customers and 
personalize marketing for each group. In order to execute and 
apply the scientific approach using K-Means algorithm, the real 
time transactional and retail dataset are analyzed. Spread over 
a specific duration of business transactions, the dataset values 
and parameters provide an organized understanding of the 
customer buying patterns and behavior across various regions. 
This study is based on the RFM (Recency, Frequency and
Monetary) model and deploys dataset segmentation principles 
using K-Means Algorithm. The results thus obtained about sales 
transactions are compared with various parameters like Sales 
Recency, Sales Frequency and Sales Volume
